Delighted to present the Tragedy Assisting Band System (TABS), a project developed for my 2nd-semester Digital Logic Design course using Arduino! TABS is designed to enhance safety for children and women during emergencies such as harassment or kidnapping. Here's a concise overview:

Core Features:
1. SOS Alert Activation:
 - Press and hold the SOS button for 4 seconds to trigger an alert.
 - Sends an SMS with the userâ€™s location to designated contacts.

2. Periodic Location Updates:
 - Automatically sends location updates every 5 minutes while in SOS mode.

3. Location Retrieval on Demand:
 - Respond to "Get location" SMS commands with the current device location.

Key Components:
- ESP32 Microcontroller:Acts as the central processor, managing inputs, outputs, and communication between the components.
- SIM 800L GSM Module: Facilitates SMS messaging.
- Neo6M GPS Module:Provides real-time location data.
- SOS Button: Activates the alert system when held for 4 seconds. 

Development Status:
- Current State:Fully functional prototype with all essential features implemented and tested.
- Next Steps:Focus on designing a wearable version for practical, everyday use.

Practical Applications:
- Child Safety: Provides immediate alerts and tracking for parents.
- Women's Safety: Enables quick communication with authorities in dangerous situations.

Conclusion:
TABS integrates advanced technology with user-friendly features to offer real-time tracking and prompt emergency responses. Follow along as we advance TABS into a user-friendly wearable device!
